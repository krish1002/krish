  <p><h4 style="text-align:justify;">The e-Vegetable Marketing Portal is mainly developed for vegetable, fruits, food grains and organic products markets. They should be capable for supplying vegetable, fruits, food grains and organic products to user or customer and they should specialize in this field and can spontaneously shipping high standard item at contentious prices. The products are originated protectively and their main motive is to meet the needs of all customers, does not matter whether the business is small scale or large scale. I tried to give provision to store data previously. Like category and sub category, it will help at the time of adding inventory of that particular vegetable, fruits, food grains and organic products.
